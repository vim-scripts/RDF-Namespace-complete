In a file with namespace prefix declarations similar to XML, Turtle/Notation3 or SPARQL, call

  :RDF

to turn on completion on terms within a namespace using the preceding prefix. This will load all RDF/XML and n3-files found in one of the following dirs:

  - $RDF_MODEL_FILES (environment variable)
  - ~/rdfmodels/
  - ~/Documents/rdfmodels/
  - /usr/local/share/rdfmodels/

Call

  :RDF reload

to reload model files, and

  :RDF quit

to restore the original omnifunc (if any).
